# Modern Web Development with TDD
## An Example

An example of using TDD to drive the design of a web application that's split
into a rich client and a REST-based service.

The principles should apply to any language/framework, but this example will
use [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for the client and
[Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for the service.
