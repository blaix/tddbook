# Modern Web Development with TDD

This book will cover one way you can use TDD to drive the design of a web application that's split into a rich client and a REST-based service.

The principles should apply to any language/framework, but this example will use [AngularJS][1] for the client and [Django Rest Framework][2] for the service.
